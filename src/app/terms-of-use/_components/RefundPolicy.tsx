				At apppopper systems, we strive for 100% accuracy in every

				suppliers.

				<h3 className='font-bold text-gray-800'>1. Eligibility for Refunds</h3>
				<p>You are entitled to a full refund in the following cases:</p>
				<ul className='list-disc pl-5 mt-2 space-y-2'>
					<li>
						<strong>Out of Stock:</strong> If an item you paid for becomes
						unavailable before procurement.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Wrong Item:</strong> If we procure a completely different
						item from what you ordered (e.g., you ordered a Blue Bag, and we
						bought a Red Shoe).
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Damaged on Arrival:</strong> If the item arrives at our
						Nigerian office with significant damage that makes it unusable.
						(Minor packaging dents from international shipping are excluded).
					</li>
				</ul>

					2. Non-Refundable Situations
				</h3>
				<p>We cannot offer refunds for:</p>
				<ul className='list-disc pl-5 mt-2 space-y-2'>
					<li>
						<strong>Change of Mind:</strong> Once an order is placed with a
						supplier in China/Turkey, it cannot be canceled.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Sizing Issues:</strong> We buy exactly the size you request.
						Please consult the supplier's size chart before ordering.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Color Variance:</strong> Slight differences in color due to
						studio lighting or screen resolution.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h3 className='font-bold text-gray-800'>3. The Return Process</h3>
				<ul className='list-disc pl-5 mt-2 space-y-2'>
					<li>
						<strong>Inspection Window:</strong> You must inspect your goods and
						report any issues within 48 hours of pickup or delivery.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Evidence:</strong> You must provide a clear video of the
						unboxing (Opening Video) and photos of the defect.
					</li>

					4. Missing Items & Supplier Discrepancies
				</h3>
				<p>
					At apppopper systems, we act as your dedicated procurement agent. While
					we vet suppliers, we do not control their internal packing process. In
					the rare event that a supplier fails to ship an item or sends an
					incomplete order, the following policy applies:
				</p>
				<ul className='list-disc pl-5 mt-2 space-y-2'>
					<li>
						<strong>Re-order Protocol:</strong> Our primary resolution for
						missing items is an automatic Re-order. We will immediately engage
						the supplier to ship the missing item in our next available cargo
						batch at no additional service charge to you.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Alternative Resolution:</strong> If the item is out of stock
						or time-sensitive, the value of the missing item will be converted
						into a Store Credit/Wallet Balance for your future procurement.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Refund Exception:</strong> Cash refunds for missing items
						are only processed if the supplier confirms they cannot fulfill the
						order and has refunded the funds to our corporate account. Please
						allow 5–7 business days for international payment reversals to
						reflect.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</section>

			<p className='mt-4'>
				<strong>Important Note:</strong> To claim a missing item, a continuous{" "}
				<strong>Unboxing Video</strong> (from the moment the seal is broken
				until every item is counted) is mandatory. Without this video, we cannot
				file a dispute with the international supplier on your behalf.
